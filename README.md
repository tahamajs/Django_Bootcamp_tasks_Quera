## Project List
### Project 1: One-Liner Problem (CA1)
#### Description
A Python exercise focused on writing efficient code using a single line of logic. The task involves modifying input based on conditions, creating a list, sorting it, and printing the resultâ€”all in one line.
#### Key Skills and Concepts
- **List Comprehensions**: Creating lists using a single line of code with conditional logic.
- **Conditional Expressions**: Applying `if-else` logic within a list comprehension.
- **Python Built-in Functions**: Utilizing functions like `sorted()` and `print()` effectively.
#### Challenge
- Modify a list of inputs based on specific conditions.
- Implement sorting and output in one concise line.

### Project 2: Greedy Algorithm Contest (CA2)
#### Description
An algorithmic challenge to solve a scheduling problem using a greedy algorithm. The goal is to maximize the number of non-overlapping events.
#### Key Skills and Concepts
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Time Complexity Management**: Writing algorithms that efficiently handle large datasets.
- **Competitive Programming Techniques**: Reading input efficiently and optimizing code for performance.
#### Challenge
- Schedule events to maximize usage without overlaps.
- Handle large input sizes within time constraints.

### Project 3: Graph and Tree Problem (CA3)
#### Description
A problem centered around calculating the sum of all paths in a binary tree. The exercise emphasizes graph traversal techniques.
#### Key Skills and Concepts
- **Tree Traversal Algorithms**: Implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Graph Theory**: Understanding nodes, edges, and pathfinding.
- **Recursive Programming**: Utilizing recursion to navigate tree structures.
#### Challenge
- Accurately calculate the sum of all possible paths.
- Optimize traversal to avoid redundant computations.

### Project 4: Orange Startup (CA4)
#### Description
A Django web application developed for an orange-selling business to manage sales and orders.
#### Key Features
- **Models**:
  - `Seller`: Extended user model with additional fields.
  - `Product`: Includes attributes like `price`, `weight`, and `due_date`.
  - `Order`: Manages order details linked to `Product` and `Seller`.
- **Custom Validators**:
  - Implemented password validation using both Argon2 and SHA-1 encryption.
  - Enforced strong password policies.
- **Django Jalali Calendar**:
  - Integrated Jalali (Persian) date fields using third-party libraries.
- **Admin Panel Customization**:
  - Displayed specific fields in the admin list view.
  - Added search functionality for models.
#### Skills Applied
- **Django ORM**: Designing models with relationships and custom fields.
- **Custom User Models**: Extending Django's default `User` model.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implementing password hashing and validation.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Using external libraries for additional functionalities.

### Project 5: StackUnderflow (CA5)
#### Description
A Q&A platform inspired by StackOverflow, allowing users to post questions and answers with upvote and downvote functionality.
#### Key Features
- **Models**:
  - `User`: Extended to include `phone_number` and `national_id`.
  - `Question`: Users can post questions with titles and descriptions.
  - `Answer`: Users can provide answers to questions.
- **Upvote/Downvote System**:
  - Implemented voting mechanisms for questions and answers.
  - Calculated scores based on votes.
- **Authentication and Permissions**:
  - Only registered users can post and vote.
  - Utilized Django's authentication system.
#### Skills Applied
- **Django Forms and Templates**: Creating dynamic forms and rendering data.
- **Advanced QuerySets**: Filtering and annotating data based on votes.
- **Business Logic Implementation**: Handling complex interactions between models.

### Project 6: Logistics System (CA6)
#### Description
Developed a system for managing warehouses and orders for a logistics company, including tracking products and managing stock levels.
#### Key Features
- **Models**:
  - `Inventory`: Tracks product quantities and warehouse locations.
  - `Product`: Details like `weight`, `price`, and `category`.
  - `Order`: Manages customer orders linked to products.
- **Views and Forms**:
  - Implemented CRUD operations for orders and inventory management.
  - Utilized class-based views for efficient code organization.
- **Admin Customization**:
  - Enhanced the admin interface with custom list displays and filters.
  - Added inline editing capabilities.
#### Skills Applied
- **Class-Based Views**: Leveraging Django's generic views for common patterns.
- **Model Relationships**: Handling `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` relationships.
- **User Authentication**: Restricting access to certain views based on user roles.
